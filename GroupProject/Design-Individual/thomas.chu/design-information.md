Design information.
1. To fulfil the requirement, in my design I added User, List, and Item classes with addItem(), deleteItem() and changeQuantity() methods to add, delete, and change quantity of items that will be defined by the user.
2. To realize this requirement, I added two classes Item and ItemType. In the Item class addItem, deleteItem and searchItem methods will fulfil for adding, deleting and searching item by user demand. In the ItemType class the method addnewType method will fulfil for adding new item type which is not included in the database already.
3. The Aggregation relationship between Item and ItemType fulfil the requirement.
4. The addnewType() method in ItemType class met the requirement.
5. The saveList() method would satisfied the requirement.
6. The modifyList() method would satisfied the requirement.
7. The clearList() method would satisfied the requirement.
8. Not considered because it won't affect the design directly.
9. The showList() method would satisfied the requirement.
10. The Composition relationship between User and List satisfied the requirement.
11. Not considered because it doesn't affect the design directly. Moreover if needed, the UI can design later.
